    <h1>Here We Go!</h1>
      <p>This is an attempt to follow <i>ALL</i> the instructions I've read so far in
        the coding course I am taking. Early last week, my frustration got the better of me and I
        wondered if I should quit. I have decided not to quit, but to go back to
        the beginning and review <i>EVERYTHING</i> with a fine-toothed comb, making notes
        as I go. I was encouraged by the evaluation of my Dashmoto's project and,
        even though I only got a <b>satisfactory</b> rating, I thought that with
        a little more time and a LOT more practice I could become a coder! My goal
        with this little personal project is to see if I can successfully:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create content for an HTML webpage.</li>
            <li>Add some flair with CSS.</li>
            <li>Get the whole damn thing loaded in GitHub using Command Line and
              ...</li>
            <li>...published on the web!</li>
          </ol>
        <p>I don't plan to make a very lengthy web page, but I do plan to practice
          the various things I have learned, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>setting up a basic HTML structure</li>
            <li>bits and bobs of special formatting, using <i>italics</i> and
            <b>bold</b></li>
            <li>understanding what the hell a "div" tag really does and why I have
              to use them</li>
            <li>and anything else I remember as I go</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="issues">
      <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p>While I think the Codecademy course is laid out pretty well for the
          HTML pieces, when one moves beyond that, the course loses some integrity.
          Startiing in the CSS modules, there are inconsistencies and the learner
          is asked to practice things to which he hasn't been exposed. It seems to be
          an error of missing instruction rather than an excercise in creating some sort of
          cognitive dissonance. This leads to significant frustration on the part of
          the learner.</p>
        <p>The other big issue is that is a learner asks a question of a mentor
          or chat representative (or both) the answers are usually different. This
          can create frustration, as well.</p>
        <p>The Slack channel is disorganized and useless. Far to disorganized to be
          helpful to a beginning learner.</p>
        <p>Finally, there are very few examples of proper syntax provided in a clear
          and straightforward manner. This leads to a lot of Internet surfing, which
          is, at best, time consuming. At worst, it is unhelpful.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="suggestions">
        <h2>Suggestions</h2>
          <p>The course should be reviewed for instructional integrity with an eye
            towards ensuring that all content is provided and information is presented
            in a logical order.</p>
          <p>While the mentors may have their unique
          and preferred ways to doing things, the ENTIRE course should be taught
          using singular instruction so that all learners get the same answers regardless
          of who answers their questions.</p>
          <p>Consider having different Slack channels for things like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Introductions (the learners introduce themselves)</li>
              <li>External useful content (learners can share resources they have
                found outside the course)</li>
              <li>HTML (learners can ask any question about HTML)</li>
              <li>CSS (learners can ask any question about CSS)</li>
              <li>Command Line (learners can ask any question about command line)
                and consider using sub-channels for the various types of terminals
                available</li>
              <li>GitHub (learners can ask any question about GitHub)</li>
            </ul>
           <p>It would be very helpful to have supplemental materials available
            at the conclusion of each lesson that provide not only a recap of proper syntax
            but also what it should look like. Something like what is found in Duckett's book,
            "HTML & CSS". This way, the learner could download these as reference guides and
            be able to see what proper syntax should look like for whatever was included in
            the lesson.</p>
