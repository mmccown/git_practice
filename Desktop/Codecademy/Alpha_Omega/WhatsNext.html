  <h1>What's Next</h1>

    <p>If I can successfully create a simple, multi-page website that has images,
      hyperlinks, an email link, and background color, a header image on each page and then, get it
      pushed to GitHub and available as a live site, I will be quite proud of myself
      and confident enough to tackle the next stages of the course. <br>Hopefully, the feedback
    provided here will be useful to those responsible for writing and running the Codecademy
  course.</p>
